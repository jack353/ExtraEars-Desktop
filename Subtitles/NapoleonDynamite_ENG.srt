1
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,572
What are you gonna do today, Napoleon?

2
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,128
Whatever I feel like I want to do. Gosh!

3
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:22,973
Your current event, Napoleon.

4
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:39,720
Last week, Japanese
scientists explaced...

5
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:43,420
placed explosive detonators
at the bottom of Lake Loch Ness...

6
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,554
to blow Nessie out of the water.

7
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:54,640
Sir Curt Godfrey of the Nessie Alliance...

8
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:57,205
summoned the help of
Scotland's local wizards...

9
00:05:57,228 --> 00:06:01,800
to cast a protective spell over the lake
and its local residents...

10
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:06,929
and all those who seek for the peaceful
existence of our underwater ally.

11
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:26,731
Yes. Yes.

12
00:06:26,832 --> 00:06:28,800
Yes. Yes.

13
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,296
Hey, Napoleon, what'd you
do all last summer again?

14
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:38,238
I told you. I spent it with my uncle
in Alaska hunting wolverines.

15
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:41,121
- Did you shoot any?
- Yes, like 50 of 'em.

16
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:45,269
They kept tryin' to attack my cousins. What
the heck would you do in a situation like that?

17
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:50,092
- What kind of gun did you use?
- A frickin' 12-gauge. What do you think?

18
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,814
You think you're funny?
Just watch your step.

19
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,418
But I didn't...

20
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:04,729
Hey, could I use your
guys's phone for a sec?

21
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:08,597
- Is there anything wrong?
- I don't feel very good.

22
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,920
- Hi.
- Is Grandma there?

23
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,285
<i>No, she's getting her hair done.</i>

24
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,185
- What do you need?
<i>- Can you just go get her for me?</i>

25
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:47,628
- I'm really busy right now.
- Well, just tell her to come get me.

26
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:50,341
<i>- Why?</i>
- 'Cause I don't feel good.

27
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:54,498
- Well, have you talked to the school nurse?
- No, she doesn't know anything.

28
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:57,630
- Will you just come get me?
- No.

29
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:59,556
Well, will you do me a favour then?

30
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,539
<i>- What?</i>
- Can you bring me my ChapStick?

31
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:05,205
<i>- No, Napoleon.</i>
- But my lips hurt real bad.

32
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:09,044
Just borrow some from the school nurse.
I know she has, like, five sticks in her drawer.

33
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm not gonna use hers, you sicko.

34
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:13,652
<i>See ya.</i>

35
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:16,689
Idiot!

36
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:21,056
<i>David Dempke, please come to the office.</i>

37
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:23,918
<i>- David Dempke.
- You do understand English?</i>

38
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:27,725
This isn't that complex.
Look, the cafeteria's down the hall...

39
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,823
to the right and downstairs.

40
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:33,293
Hey, is that a new kid or something?

41
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:35,303
Napoleon, this is Pedro.

42
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:37,566
Would you mind showing
him where his locker is?

43
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,049
Sure. Come on.

44
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,873
You know, there's, like,
a butt load of gangs at this school.

45
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:51,975
This one gang kept wanting me to join
'cause I'm pretty good with a bow staff.

46
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:57,089
Do you ride the bus to school?

47
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,090
No. I ride my bike.

48
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:02,251
- What kind of bike do you have?
- It's a Sledgehammer.

49
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:04,176
Dang!

50
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:06,871
You got shocks, pegs.

51
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:09,100
Lucky!

52
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:13,797
You ever take it off any sweet jumps?

53
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:22,344
You got, like, three feet of air that time.

54
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:26,514
Can I try it really quick?

55
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:35,082
Dang it!

56
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:37,253
I love the way...

57
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:39,348
your sandy hair...

58
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:42,018
floats in the air.

59
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:44,755
To me it's like a lullaby.

60
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:48,798
I'm just flying by, oh, so high...

61
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,173
like a kite tied to a stake.

62
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:58,440
How was school?

63
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:00,906
The worst day of my life.
What do you think?

64
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:04,375
Well, I want you to go see
if Tina wants some of this.

65
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:10,130
Kip hasn't done flipping anything today.

66
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:13,716
Look, tonight me and your...
Kip, listen!

67
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,727
What?

68
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,222
Tonight me and your aunt are
gonna go visit some friends...

69
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:19,223
and we're not gonna be back till tomorrow.

70
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:23,125
We're gettin' low on steak, so I got Lyle
comin' over tomorrow to take care of it.

71
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:26,026
- Well, what's there to eat?
- Knock it off, Napoleon.

72
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:28,974
Make yourself a dang quesadilla!

73
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,224
Fine!

74
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:32,557
I'll be back tomorrow.

75
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,783
Stay home and eat all the
freakin' chips, Kip!

76
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:46,408
Napoleon, don't be jealous that I've been
chatting online with babes all day.

77
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:49,915
Besides, we both know
I'm training to become a cage fighter.

78
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,865
Since when, Kip?
You have the worst reflexes of all time.

79
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,913
- Try and hit me, Napoleon.
- What?

80
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,990
I said come down here and see
what happens if you try and hit me.

81
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,321
Such an idiot.

82
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,555
Let me see what your best move is.

83
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:16,531
I'll go get it.

84
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:19,012
Geez!

85
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,415
Um, hello.

86
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:30,279
Would you like to look like this?

87
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,728
This is a girl.

88
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:39,480
Because for a limited time only...

89
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:42,115
glamour shots by Deb are 75% off.

90
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:44,669
I already get my hair cut
at the Cuttin' Corral.

91
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:50,057
Well, maybe you'd be interested
in some home-woven handicrafts.

92
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:54,897
<i>I'm Rex, founder of the Rex
Kwon Do Self-Defense System.</i>

93
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,873
<i>After one week with me in my dojo,
you'll be prepared to defend yourself...</i>

94
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:01,101
<i>with the strength of a grizzly...</i>

95
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:05,306
<i>The reflexes of a puma...</i>

96
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:07,960
<i>and the wisdom of a man.</i>

97
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:11,978
<i>Come down today for your free trial lesson!</i>

98
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:19,056
In here we have some boondoggle key chains.

99
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:21,421
A must-have for this season's fashion.

100
00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:24,947
I already made, like, infinity
of those at Scout camp.

101
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,985
Well, is anyone else here?

102
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,728
I'm trying to earn money for college.

103
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,300
Your mom goes to college.

104
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:34,620
Let's bring in that...

105
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:57,751
Tina, you fat lard.
Come get some dinner.

106
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:05,564
Tina, eat. Eat the food.

107
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:08,509
Eat the food!

108
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:27,180
It'd be nice if you could
pull me into town.

109
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,547
My name is Rex, and if you study
with my eight-week program...

110
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:46,264
you will learn a system of self-defense...

111
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:49,295
that I developed over two seasons
of fighting in the Octagon.

112
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,208
It's called Rex Kwon Do!

113
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:53,943
I need a volunteer.

114
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:58,379
Okay, you'll do. Come up here.

115
00:13:59,446 --> 00:14:02,541
Bow to your sensei. Bow to your sensei!

116
00:14:03,003 --> 00:14:04,237
Okay.

117
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,804
Now, I'm gonna give you one chance.

118
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:09,542
One chance, people.
Give me your best shot.

119
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:16,147
All right. That was pretty good. Okay.

120
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,189
Now, watch this, everybody.

121
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,417
Grab my arm. The other arm.

122
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,460
My other arm.

123
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,324
Okay, now watch this. I'm just gonna break
the wrist and walk away.

124
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,330
Break the wrist, walk away.

125
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:29,491
- Geez!
- Okay.

126
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:32,296
It's just that simple.
Now, I want you to kick me.

127
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:34,462
Come on. Kick me.

128
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,538
Okay, do it again.

129
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,699
Do it again.

130
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,641
- Ouch.
- Okay. You'll block it every time.

131
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:45,338
Have a seat.

132
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:48,306
Now, in addition to what you just saw...

133
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:51,546
if you study with my eight-week program,
you're gonna learn these things.

134
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:53,429
First off...

135
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:55,587
Rex Kwon Do, we use the buddy system.

136
00:14:55,689 --> 00:15:00,182
No more flyin' solo. You need somebody
watching your back at all times.!

137
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:03,523
Second off, you're gonna learn
to discipline your image.

138
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:05,793
Do you think I got where I am today...

139
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:07,509
because I dress like Peter Pan here?

140
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,628
Take a look at what I'm wearing, people.

141
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:13,791
Do you think anybody wants
a roundhouse kick to the face...

142
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:16,384
while I'm wearin' these bad boys?

143
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:19,728
Forget about it. Last off...

144
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:23,669
my students will learn about self-respect.

145
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:28,401
Do you think anybody thinks I'm a failure
because I go home to Starla at night?

146
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:30,457
Forget about it.!

147
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:34,624
Now, for only $300, you
can sign up right now...

148
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:36,876
for my eight-week program.

149
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:45,896
Well, that place was a rip-off.

150
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:06,731
Hey, Lyle.

151
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:20,733
Nothin' on here works smooth.

152
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,494
So me and you are pretty
much friends by now, right?

153
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:46,485
Yes.

154
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:48,757
So, you got my back and everything?

155
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,413
What?

156
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:52,934
Never mind.

157
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,677
- Have you heard about the dance?
- Yes.

158
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:00,985
Have you met anyone to ask yet?

159
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:04,616
No. But I probably will after school.

160
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:06,899
Who you gonna ask?

161
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:09,313
That girl over there.

162
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,712
She braided my hair one time...

163
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,095
Summer Wheatly?
How the heck are you gonna do that?

164
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:17,431
Build her a cake or something.

165
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:20,625
Yeah, my old girlfriend from Oklahoma...

166
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,878
was gonna fly out here for the dance...

167
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:26,253
but she couldn't 'cause she's doing
some modelling right now.

168
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:28,378
Is she hot?

169
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,002
See for yourself.

170
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:38,444
Wow.

171
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:43,772
Yeah, I took her to the mall to get some
glamour shots for her birthday one year.

172
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:47,338
- I like her bangs.
- Me too.

173
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:55,768
How long did it take you
to grow that moustache?

174
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:57,325
A couple of days.

175
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,839
I wish I could grow one.

176
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:07,430
Are you gonna eat your Tots?

177
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:10,295
No.

178
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:11,663
Can I have 'em?

179
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:44,555
You see that girl over there?

180
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:47,308
She came over to my house the other day.

181
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:49,303
- Why?
- I don't know...

182
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:51,946
but she left all this crap on my porch.

183
00:19:53,588 --> 00:19:55,646
She's pretty good-looking.

184
00:19:55,913 --> 00:19:57,972
Do you dare me to go talk to her?

185
00:19:58,996 --> 00:19:59,924
Sure.

186
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,229
I see you're drinking one-percent.
Is that 'cause you think you're fat?

187
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:22,244
'Cause you're not. You could be
drinking whole if you wanted to.

188
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:27,364
Well, I have all your
equipment in my locker.

189
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:31,696
You should probably come get it 'cause
I can't fit my nunchakus in there anymore.

190
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:35,516
Where's your locker?

191
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:46,688
Hey, can I have one of your key chains?

192
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:41,856
Hello?

193
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:11,755
Napoleon, give me some of your Tots.

194
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:14,577
- No, go find your own.
- Come on. Give me some of your Tots.

195
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:17,781
No. I'm freakin' starved.
I didn't get to eat anything today.

196
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:20,381
G...

197
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:22,892
Gross.

198
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:26,124
Freakin' idiot!

199
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:35,033
Tina, come get some ham.

200
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:04,922
What are you doing here, Uncle Rico?

201
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,150
Your grandma took a little spill at
the sand dunes today, broke her coccyx.

202
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,122
What? Since when does she go to the dunes?

203
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,678
Looks like there's a lot
you don't know about her.

204
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:36,402
- So, when's Grandma coming back?
- I don't know.

205
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:37,996
Not sure.

206
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:40,808
You don't have to stay here with us.
We're not babies.

207
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,727
Talk to your Auntie Caroline.

208
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:47,343
Well, Kip is, like, 32 years old.

209
00:23:47,497 --> 00:23:49,109
I don't mind if you stay.

210
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:52,288
Thanks, Kip.

211
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:56,037
What the flip was Grandma
doin' at the sand dunes?

212
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:59,678
She was on a date...
with her boyfriend.

213
00:23:59,725 --> 00:24:01,885
Boyfriend?

214
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:05,524
Hey, you guys want to see my video?

215
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:31,815
So, what do you think?

216
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:34,902
- It's pretty cool, I guess.
- Oh.

217
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:37,118
Man, I wish I could go back in time.

218
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,178
I'd take state.

219
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:41,909
This is pretty much the
worst video ever made.

220
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:44,993
Napoleon, like anyone can even know that.

221
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,314
You know what, Napoleon? You can leave.

222
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:50,298
You guys are retarded.

223
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:54,338
Hey, check that out.

224
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:11,544
So, you and Tammy still together?

225
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,042
No. Not really.

226
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:18,724
- Why is that?
- Well...

227
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:21,475
she's jealous.

228
00:25:21,577 --> 00:25:24,375
Says I'm livin' too much in '82.

229
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,275
Well, I dumped her.

230
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:32,167
What about your girlfriend?

231
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:34,708
Well, things are gettin'
pretty serious right now.

232
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:38,043
I mean, we chat online for,
like, two hours every day...

233
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:41,510
so I guess you could say
things are gettin' pretty serious.

234
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:47,448
I'm just really tryin' to raise a few bucks right
now so I can bring her around for a few days.

235
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,087
Yep. Well, what's she look like?

236
00:25:51,432 --> 00:25:53,888
She's, uh...
She's got sandy blonde hair.

237
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:55,822
She's, uh, pretty-look...

238
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,764
pretty good-looking face, but...

239
00:25:57,786 --> 00:26:00,169
I'm just gettin' really...
just kinda T.O.'d...

240
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:04,066
because, I mean, she hasn't even
sent me a full body shot yet.

241
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:10,014
Hey, you know...

242
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,044
I got a little project...

243
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,881
that we might be able to
make a little moola with.

244
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:19,326
Really? That sounds pretty good.

245
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:22,282
Have you ever heard of nylon polymer?

246
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:26,004
Go for it.

247
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:03,293
Back in '82, I used to be able
to throw a pigskin a quarter mile.

248
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:06,125
- Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

249
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:11,369
Watch this.

250
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,336
What the heck are you doing?

251
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:21,256
That's what I'm talkin' about.

252
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:23,280
I better go.

253
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:35,974
How much you want to make a bet I can
throw a football over them mountains?

254
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,425
Yeah. If coach would've put
me in fourth quarter...

255
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,358
we'd have been state champions, no doubt.

256
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,294
No doubt in my mind.

257
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:49,022
You better believe things
would have been different.

258
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:52,223
I'd have gone pro... in a heartbeat.

259
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:54,543
I'd be makin' millions of dollars and...

260
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:59,111
livin' in a...
big ol' mansion somewhere.

261
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:02,694
You know, soakin' it up in a
hot tub with my soul mate.

262
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,931
Kip...

263
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:12,974
I reckon you know a lot about cyberspace.

264
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,257
Y- You ever come across
anything like time travel?

265
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:21,043
Easy.

266
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,966
I've already looked into it for myself.

267
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:28,880
Right on.

268
00:28:29,304 --> 00:28:31,238
Right on.

269
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:04,061
Is Pedro here today?

270
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:06,756
I don't think so. Why?

271
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:09,558
Just wondering.

272
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:11,792
Can you, uh, give this to him for me?

273
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,300
Okay.

274
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:19,756
Hey, Summer, you want to play me?

275
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:36,814
God.

276
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,842
- What are you drawing?
- A liger.

277
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:51,381
What's a liger?

278
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:53,475
It's pretty much my favourite animal.

279
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,618
It's like a lion and a tiger mixed.

280
00:29:55,937 --> 00:29:58,337
Bred for its skills in magic.

281
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,342
Where's your friend?

282
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,217
I don't know. Did you see him today?

283
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:11,558
No.

284
00:30:11,652 --> 00:30:13,619
Neither did I.

285
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:17,601
- Do you need a ride?
- No.

286
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:20,922
I missed the bus today, but
my uncle's coming to get me.

287
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:22,898
Oh.

288
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:30,894
See ya.

289
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,034
Right. I... I think...

290
00:30:45,113 --> 00:30:47,823
just a little bit east of the cemetery
is a good little area right here.

291
00:30:47,835 --> 00:30:51,677
We should do it right there. Don't go down here,
'cause they don't have any money.

292
00:30:51,732 --> 00:30:54,963
So, how long are we talkin' about workin'?

293
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,349
What are you...
You're already losing your steam?

294
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,777
No. I just...
I have a chat room meeting at 4:00.

295
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:02,803
I gotta be back here by then.

296
00:31:02,845 --> 00:31:06,110
- All right, you just start a little earlier. That's all.
- All right.

297
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:08,799
Or else work afterwards.
How long's the chat room?

298
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:11,981
Geez, sometimes up to
three, four hours maybe.

299
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:16,249
Maybe not. I don't know.

300
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,276
You... You pay the bills for that?

301
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,830
Does that cost money every time
you're on, like for minutes on the phone?

302
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,424
Yeah. Grandma's still payin' per minute.

303
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,507
She gets kind of pissed at me
sometimes 'cause I'm on there so long.

304
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:30,088
I'll bet she does.
I'd be throwin' you out the window.

305
00:31:33,593 --> 00:31:35,656
<i>- Bueno.</i>
- Hello?

306
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:37,981
<i>- Who's this?</i>
- Napoleon Dynamite.

307
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,396
- Who?
<i>- Napoleon Dynamite.</i>

308
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,840
- I'm one of Pedro's best friends.
<i>- Your name is Napoleon?</i>

309
00:31:43,864 --> 00:31:46,025
Yes. Is Pedro there?

310
00:31:46,063 --> 00:31:48,054
<i>No, he's not here right now.</i>

311
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:50,132
Okay, bye.

312
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:54,216
See, Crystal Street. That's for you.

313
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:57,959
I'm goin' to Adams Park.
They got some money in Adams Park.

314
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:02,133
What?

315
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,934
Let's go, Kipper.
I think we should take this...

316
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:06,736
- someplace a little more private.
- That's a good idea.

317
00:32:08,313 --> 00:32:10,372
Please. Please. Be good to me.

318
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,787
Please, keep going. Dead on. Dead on.

319
00:32:16,825 --> 00:32:18,161
Yes!

320
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,477
Before we get started on our new project,
I have a few concerns.

321
00:32:31,021 --> 00:32:33,779
First off, I'm concerned about
your transportation situation.

322
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,849
I mean, do you... you got a car
you can borrow from someone?

323
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:38,939
Well, that's the problem right now.

324
00:32:39,368 --> 00:32:41,268
At the moment, nothing comes to mind.

325
00:32:48,347 --> 00:32:52,806
You can borrow my van for the time being.
I... I do better on foot anyway.

326
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:56,622
We also need some way to make us
look official, like we got all the answers.

327
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,592
How about some gold bracelets?

328
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:02,540
We need, like, some name tags...

329
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:05,009
with our picture on it, all
laminated and whatnot.

330
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:07,165
I mean, we gotta look legit, man.

331
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,118
That's true. That's true.

332
00:33:09,164 --> 00:33:11,587
Say, you know of a... a place
we can get our picture taken...

333
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,500
like a... a photo store?

334
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,313
Okay.

335
00:33:15,353 --> 00:33:17,947
Turn your head on more of a slant.

336
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,577
Now, make a fist...

337
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:24,822
and slowly ease it up underneath your chin.

338
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,389
- This is looking really good.
- You can say that again.

339
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,701
Okay, hold still right there.

340
00:33:36,991 --> 00:33:39,960
Now, just imagine you're weightless.

341
00:33:40,781 --> 00:33:42,976
You're in the middle of the ocean...

342
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,998
surrounded by tiny little sea horses.

343
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:55,953
That was the one. I think
that's gonna come out really nice.

344
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:59,550
Uh, you did it?

345
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:03,319
Wow. Wow, that felt really relaxed.

346
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:05,403
Thanks, Deb.

347
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:09,972
You're up, Kip.

348
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:14,323
Is there some kind of vest that I can wear?

349
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:26,875
- Where have you been?
- I got sick.

350
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:30,591
Has Summer said anything to you yet?

351
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,689
No, not yet.

352
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,516
Well, she said no.

353
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,474
She did?

354
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:41,294
- Well, what about that other girl?
- What other girl?

355
00:34:41,343 --> 00:34:44,402
- The one that left all that crap on your porch.
- You mean Deb?

356
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:47,379
- Yes, her.
- What about her?

357
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,737
- Well, I asked her out too.
- What?

358
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,873
Well, nobody's gonna go out with me.

359
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:30,456
- Have you asked anybody yet?
- No, but who would?

360
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,856
- I don't even have any good skills.
- What do you mean?

361
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:36,052
You know, like...

362
00:35:36,348 --> 00:35:39,780
nunchaku skills, bow hunting skills...

363
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:42,099
computer hacking skills.

364
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,627
Girls only want boyfriends
who have great skills.

365
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:48,228
Aren't you pretty good at drawing, like...

366
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:50,157
animals and warriors and stuff?

367
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:51,637
Yes.

368
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,283
Probably the best that I know of.

369
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,997
Just draw a picture of the
girl you want to take out...

370
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,116
and give it to her for,
like, a gift or something.

371
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:03,348
That's a pretty good idea.

372
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:35,038
Now, if you invest in the 24-piece set...

373
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,390
I'm gonna throw in a little gift.

374
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,226
So, what's the gift?

375
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:44,636
I bet you folks don't have one of these.

376
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:51,014
I want that.

377
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:54,850
You see, this ain't your
run-of-the-mill crapper-ware.

378
00:36:54,928 --> 00:36:58,443
These are some serious
NuPont fiber-woven bowls.

379
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:02,019
So, if we purchase the 24-piece set...

380
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:04,469
the mini sail boat is included?

381
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,453
That's correct, sir.

382
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:09,610
Lance, you look like a strong young pup.

383
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:14,497
Why don't you see if you
can give that a nice tear.

384
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,656
Don't hurt yourself now.

385
00:37:24,684 --> 00:37:26,617
I can't do it.

386
00:37:26,648 --> 00:37:28,809
Can't.

387
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:33,888
So, uh...

388
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:36,373
how does the dealio sound to you?

389
00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:53,762
Dang it.

390
00:38:16,822 --> 00:38:20,383
- Is Trisha here?
- Oh, I'm sorry, she's not.

391
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:23,642
- She's at a friend's house right now.
- Well, hey, Napoleon.

392
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,357
- Napoleon's my nephew.
- Oh, that's nice.

393
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:33,918
Could you just give this to her for me?

394
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:37,709
- I certainly could.
- Thanks.

395
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:40,224
Bye-bye.

396
00:38:42,744 --> 00:38:47,305
Poor kid. I've been takin' care of him
while his grandma's in the hospital.

397
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:52,024
He still wets the bed and everything.

398
00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:53,110
You're kidding.

399
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:57,689
Yeah, he's a tender little guy.
He still gets beat up and whatnot.

400
00:38:58,828 --> 00:39:01,202
Anyway, uh...

401
00:39:01,224 --> 00:39:07,059
so we still feelin' pretty good about this,
uh, 32-piece set here?

402
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:10,271
What the crap was Uncle Rico
doin' at my girlfriend's house?

403
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:13,060
Napoleon, let go of me!
I think you're bruisin' my neck meat!

404
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:14,354
Fine.

405
00:39:15,742 --> 00:39:16,984
What the heck are you guys doin'?

406
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:19,984
Tryin' to ruin my life
and make me look like a friggin' idiot?

407
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:22,843
I'm out makin' some sweet
moola with Uncle Rico.

408
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:25,000
Geez, I think you ripped my mole off.

409
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:28,187
- I did?
- Yeah, is it bleeding?

410
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:30,695
A little bit.

411
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:32,335
Hey, Kip.

412
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:38,521
I wish you wouldn't look
at me like that, Napoleon.

413
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:40,855
I wish you'd get out of
my life and shut up.

414
00:39:40,894 --> 00:39:44,901
I'm gonna tell you somethin'. While you're
playin' patty-cake with your friend Pedro...

415
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:48,347
your Uncle Rico... is makin' 120 bucks.

416
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:50,592
I could make that much
money in five seconds.

417
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,154
Geez. Yeah, right, Napoleon.
I made, like, 75 bucks today.

418
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:57,139
Napoleon, it looks like
you don't have a job.

419
00:39:57,178 --> 00:39:59,146
So why don't you get out
there and feed Tina.

420
00:39:59,161 --> 00:40:01,391
Why don't you go eat a
decroded piece of crap.

421
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:07,894
There's a lot more where this came from...

422
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:09,888
if you go to the dance with me.

423
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:13,035
Yours truly, Napoleon Dynamite.

424
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:25,729
You know you're gonna go to
that dance with that boy.

425
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:32,077
By noon I need them 8,000 hens
moved into their new cages.

426
00:40:32,484 --> 00:40:34,936
Sometimes they don't want to cooperate.

427
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:38,233
But you give 'em a good shakin',
they'll settle down for ya.

428
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:40,561
Do the chickens have large talons?

429
00:40:40,596 --> 00:40:43,771
- Do they have what?
- Large talons.

430
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:46,800
I don't understand a word you just said.

431
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,090
Okay, you meet me back here
about noon, and, uh...

432
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:52,525
we'll have a little lunch waitin' for ya.

433
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,849
Well, dig in.

434
00:42:23,024 --> 00:42:24,930
Over there, in that pig pen...

435
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,767
I found a couple of Shoshone arrowheads.

436
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:43,878
Can't find my chequebook.
Hope you don't mind I pay you in change.

437
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,625
Six dollars.

438
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:53,019
That's, like, a dollar an hour.

439
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,113
Hello?

440
00:43:00,134 --> 00:43:03,129
- Hi. Is Napoleon there?
- Yes.

441
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,904
- Can I talk to him?
- You already are.

442
00:43:08,395 --> 00:43:10,038
Oh.

443
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:13,236
Napoleon, this is Trisha.

444
00:43:13,273 --> 00:43:15,433
I'm just calling to tell you that...

445
00:43:15,658 --> 00:43:18,058
I can go to the dance with you.

446
00:43:18,902 --> 00:43:20,447
And also...

447
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,932
I wanted to thank you
for the beautiful drawing you did of me.

448
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,947
- It's hanging in my bedroom.
<i>- Really?</i>

449
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:30,565
Took me, like, three hours
to finish the shading on your upper lip.

450
00:43:30,814 --> 00:43:33,304
It's probably the best
drawing I've ever done.

451
00:43:33,955 --> 00:43:36,617
Yeah, it's really... nice.

452
00:43:36,654 --> 00:43:39,986
Yeah, well, I'll probably
pick you up at 6:00 for the dance.

453
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:43,176
- Is that okay?
- That's fine.

454
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:44,837
Okay, bye.

455
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,083
Bye.

456
00:43:54,987 --> 00:43:57,921
- Who was that?
- Trisha.

457
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,619
- Who's she?
- My woman I'm takin' to the dance.

458
00:44:01,658 --> 00:44:04,922
- You draw her a picture?
- Heck, yes, I did!

459
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,863
Well, what are you going
to wear to the dance?

460
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:11,457
Just, like, a silk shirt or something.

461
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:14,115
- What are you gonna wear?
- Dad has something for me.

462
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:17,333
But you should probably get a suit.

463
00:44:21,946 --> 00:44:25,347
Pedro, how do you feel about that one?

464
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:27,118
It looks nice.

465
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:29,086
Yeah. It looks pretty sweet.

466
00:44:29,351 --> 00:44:31,410
It looks awesome.

467
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:34,324
That suit, it's... It's incredible.

468
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:18,207
I need you to give me a ride in an hour.

469
00:45:19,355 --> 00:45:21,119
Where to?

470
00:45:21,193 --> 00:45:22,888
The dance.

471
00:45:23,912 --> 00:45:26,100
- You takin' my client's daughter?
- Yes.

472
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:28,142
We need to pick her up too.

473
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:33,412
Well, Uncle Rico's got a sale
to finalize in Bonita in five minutes.

474
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:37,067
Can't you take me and then
drop me off when you're done or whatever?

475
00:45:55,116 --> 00:45:56,905
Well, I'll be back in a minute.

476
00:45:56,912 --> 00:45:58,827
Don't disturb me while I'm in there.

477
00:45:58,873 --> 00:46:01,637
Well, hurry up, 'cause I gotta get Trisha.

478
00:46:22,538 --> 00:46:26,167
Hi. I got your 24-piece set right here.

479
00:48:19,935 --> 00:48:22,920
So you guys are, like,
Pedro's cousins with all the sweet hookups?

480
00:48:23,427 --> 00:48:24,865
Simón.

481
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:39,591
Is Trisha here?

482
00:48:41,138 --> 00:48:43,038
Who's that in my driveway?

483
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:47,263
That's my ride.

484
00:49:49,384 --> 00:49:53,251
Do you wanna go over by my friend Pedro
and dance really quick?

485
00:51:04,422 --> 00:51:05,688
Napoleon.

486
00:51:06,603 --> 00:51:08,352
When did you get here?

487
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,992
Just a couple minutes ago.

488
00:51:11,054 --> 00:51:13,215
Have you guys seen Trisha anywhere?

489
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,641
No.

490
00:51:15,662 --> 00:51:17,687
Oh.

491
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:19,882
She probably just went to the bathroom.

492
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:25,589
Are you guys having a killer time?

493
00:51:25,614 --> 00:51:26,995
Yes.

494
00:51:39,715 --> 00:51:44,049
If you can't find Trisha, I'll let you
dance with Deb for a few songs.

495
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,870
I like your sleeves. They're real big.

496
00:51:57,523 --> 00:51:59,423
Thank you.

497
00:51:59,462 --> 00:52:01,953
I made them myself.

498
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:08,598
So you and Pedro are getting
really serious now?

499
00:52:09,142 --> 00:52:10,876
No.

500
00:52:10,924 --> 00:52:12,759
We're just friends.

501
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:14,587
Huh.

502
00:52:17,422 --> 00:52:19,788
How your glamour shots been going lately?

503
00:52:21,562 --> 00:52:23,530
Pretty good.

504
00:52:26,588 --> 00:52:30,216
I could do a personal portrait sometime...

505
00:52:30,691 --> 00:52:32,591
if you wanted to come over.

506
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,137
Okay.

507
00:53:26,218 --> 00:53:28,109
Do you think people will vote for me?

508
00:53:28,161 --> 00:53:31,124
Heck, yes. I'd vote for you.

509
00:53:31,187 --> 00:53:32,731
Like, what are my skills?

510
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:34,866
Well, you have a sweet bike...

511
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:39,053
and you're really good at
hookin' up with chicks.

512
00:53:39,114 --> 00:53:42,790
Plus you're, like, the only guy at school
who has a moustache.

513
00:53:42,821 --> 00:53:44,119
That's true.

514
00:53:44,135 --> 00:53:47,535
If you need to use any of my skills,
I can do whatever you want.

515
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:50,272
Thanks.

516
00:53:50,404 --> 00:53:53,634
If I win, you can be my
secretary or something.

517
00:53:53,661 --> 00:53:57,653
Sweet! Plus I could be your bodyguard too.

518
00:53:57,851 --> 00:54:02,185
Or, like, Secret Service captain or...
whatever.

519
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:03,912
Okay.

520
00:54:11,058 --> 00:54:13,424
Is that yours?

521
00:54:13,597 --> 00:54:15,894
Don't touch it. It's Uncle Rico's.

522
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:17,988
What's it for?

523
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,749
It's a time machine, Napoleon.
He bought it online.

524
00:54:25,459 --> 00:54:29,224
- Yeah, right.
- It works, Napoleon. You don't even know.

525
00:54:29,915 --> 00:54:32,145
Have you guys tried it yet?

526
00:54:32,406 --> 00:54:33,633
No.

527
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:57,249
- So, are you ready?
- Yeah. Hold on.

528
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,928
I forgot to put in the crystals.

529
00:55:03,986 --> 00:55:06,223
Okay, turn it on.

530
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:09,687
Kill...

531
00:55:09,712 --> 00:55:10,906
the pow...

532
00:55:11,283 --> 00:55:13,100
Kill...

533
00:55:14,552 --> 00:55:16,247
Turn it off! Turn it off!

534
00:55:18,956 --> 00:55:21,497
It's a piece of crap. It doesn't work.

535
00:55:22,677 --> 00:55:24,599
Well, I could've told you that.

536
00:55:37,552 --> 00:55:41,112
I-I said the 12 pack, not the 24 pack.

537
00:55:41,136 --> 00:55:43,104
You're just gonna have to mix and match.

538
00:55:43,509 --> 00:55:45,583
Shut up. Say it so the
whole world can hear.

539
00:55:45,657 --> 00:55:47,114
Well, put it back.

540
00:55:54,441 --> 00:55:57,308
Napoleon, you know we can't
afford the fun pack.

541
00:55:57,482 --> 00:56:00,895
You think money grows on trees
in this family? Take it back.

542
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:03,409
Get some Pampers for you
and your brother while you're at it.

543
00:56:08,384 --> 00:56:11,250
We can use a little of this.
I can tell you that.

544
00:56:11,807 --> 00:56:14,322
We can use those.

545
00:56:25,268 --> 00:56:28,829
The defect in that one is bleach.

546
00:56:29,212 --> 00:56:32,010
- That's correct.
- Yes!

547
00:56:44,264 --> 00:56:47,506
This tastes like the cow
got into an onion patch.

548
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:51,881
- Correct.
- Yes!

549
00:56:54,643 --> 00:56:58,169
They're pretty good except
for one little problem.

550
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:04,109
That little guy right there,
he has nipple number five.

551
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,139
A good dairy cow should have, like, four.

552
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,897
Well done.

553
00:57:09,436 --> 00:57:11,404
- Vote for Summer.
- Vote for Summer.

554
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:15,006
Vote for Summer. Thanks.

555
00:57:15,364 --> 00:57:17,695
- Yeah.
- Hi guys. Vote for Summer.

556
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:22,345
Hi. Vote for Summer.

557
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:25,030
Hi, ladies. Vote for Summer.
You guys voting?

558
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:31,823
- Do you think it's kinda warm in here?
- No.

559
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:37,469
I think it's... They have
the heater on or something.

560
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:40,616
It seems pretty good to me.

561
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:44,376
You don't feel like your head
is burning or... or anything?

562
00:57:44,517 --> 00:57:45,810
No.

563
00:57:47,045 --> 00:57:49,411
I'm gonna go home and lay down.

564
00:57:49,615 --> 00:57:51,583
Okay. See ya.

565
00:58:01,822 --> 00:58:03,134
- Vote for Summer.
- Yeah, right.

566
00:58:03,205 --> 00:58:06,080
- I'm not votin' for her.
- Then who are you gonna vote for?

567
00:58:06,161 --> 00:58:08,798
I'm votin' for Pedro Sanchez.
Who do you think?

568
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,801
Hey, Don, can I have one of those buttons?

569
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:28,075
Hey. Vote for Summer.

570
00:58:28,248 --> 00:58:30,273
Hi. Vote for Summer.

571
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:35,199
So, that guy in Florida give
you your money back yet?

572
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:38,940
Oh, I wrote him an e-mail,
sayin' I'm gonna contact the authorities...

573
00:58:38,992 --> 00:58:41,424
if I don't get a refund in full.

574
00:58:43,245 --> 00:58:46,362
Don't you ever wish you could go back...

575
00:58:46,393 --> 00:58:49,089
with all the knowledge you have now? Tsk.

576
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,039
I guess so.

577
00:58:51,072 --> 00:58:54,563
Well, I'll tell you somethin' right now.
You'd find your soul mate.

578
00:58:54,815 --> 00:58:59,185
- I've already got a soul mate.
- Oh, yeah. What's her name again?

579
00:58:59,248 --> 00:59:02,302
- Lafawnduh.
- Lafawnduh. Huh.

580
00:59:02,349 --> 00:59:05,888
- How's she doin'?
- Well, I think I'm gonna need some time off.

581
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:08,817
She's flyin' out from
Detroit for a few days.

582
00:59:08,911 --> 00:59:13,108
Well, what about work? Well, haven't...
haven't you studied up on the new product?

583
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:17,232
- Yes.
- Well, do you know it backwards and front?

584
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:18,916
Basically.

585
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:22,680
Why don't you sell some to
that girlfriend of yours?

586
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:25,136
You might as well do somethin'
while you're doin' nothin'.

587
00:59:25,177 --> 00:59:27,906
Because she doesn't need any.
That's why.

588
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:36,748
Hey. I did some drawings for the flyers.

589
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,794
Thanks.

590
00:59:38,836 --> 00:59:41,599
Why do you got your hood on like that?

591
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:46,904
Well, when I came home from school,
my head started to get really hot.

592
00:59:46,991 --> 00:59:50,688
So I drank some cold water,
but it didn't do nothing.

593
00:59:52,144 --> 00:59:54,815
So I laid in the bathtub for a while...

594
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:59,901
but then I realized that it was my hair
that was making my head so hot.

595
01:00:00,088 --> 01:00:03,489
So I went into my kitchen,
and I shaved it all off.

596
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:07,041
I don't want anyone to see.

597
01:00:08,384 --> 01:00:10,943
I know what you mean.

598
01:00:14,482 --> 01:00:16,652
There's just so many options.

599
01:00:18,529 --> 01:00:22,555
That one's good.
Looks like a medieval warrior.

600
01:00:24,222 --> 01:00:27,851
You know, you're right.
That's a good one.

601
01:00:33,314 --> 01:00:35,281
Sorry.

602
01:00:39,732 --> 01:00:42,067
I think this matches your season, Pedro.

603
01:00:42,575 --> 01:00:44,095
Thank you.

604
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,909
- Vote for Pedro.
- Vote for Pedro.

605
01:01:19,936 --> 01:01:22,165
- Vote for Pedro.
- Vote for Pedro.

606
01:01:22,489 --> 01:01:24,389
- Vote for me.
- Vote for Pedro.

607
01:01:24,436 --> 01:01:26,464
- Vote for Pedro.
- Vote for me.

608
01:01:26,524 --> 01:01:29,390
- Vote for Pedro.
- Vote for Pedro.

609
01:01:29,461 --> 01:01:31,132
Vote for Pedro.

610
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:33,609
- Vote for... Pedro.
- Vote for Pedro.

611
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,662
Hey, give me 50 cents so I can buy a pop.

612
01:01:38,693 --> 01:01:40,858
- I don't have any, Randy.
- Come on. I'll pay you back.

613
01:01:40,893 --> 01:01:43,444
I don't have... Stop.

614
01:01:44,695 --> 01:01:48,391
- Don't. Stop. Stop.
- I'll do this to you.

615
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,953
Don't.

616
01:01:50,694 --> 01:01:52,661
Here. Here.

617
01:02:05,924 --> 01:02:09,580
- How's your neck?
- Stings.

618
01:02:09,604 --> 01:02:11,594
That's too bad.

619
01:02:14,718 --> 01:02:17,179
Pedro offers you his protection.

620
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,884
- Hey, let me borrow your bike.
- No.

621
01:02:26,932 --> 01:02:29,322
- Come on. I'll give you some chips.
- No.

622
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:30,950
Like a wash, and then you
blow-dry it with bleach.

623
01:03:30,998 --> 01:03:32,966
Yeah. It's so cool.

624
01:03:39,325 --> 01:03:41,189
Hey, you Trisha?

625
01:03:41,332 --> 01:03:43,848
- Yeah.
- You remember me?

626
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:48,436
I'm a friend of your mom's.
I'm... I'm Napoleon's uncle. Uncle Rico.

627
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:53,326
- Oh. Yeah.
- Hey, could you do me a favour?

628
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:56,749
Could you give your mom
a couple of these and...

629
01:03:56,923 --> 01:04:00,187
tell 'em to hand 'em out
to her friends or whoever?

630
01:04:00,573 --> 01:04:01,766
'Kay.

631
01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:06,265
You girls give me a call
if you feel like you could use some.

632
01:04:13,988 --> 01:04:15,956
Have a nice day.

633
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:18,605
Why the heck you throwin'
crap at my van, Napoleon?

634
01:06:18,622 --> 01:06:22,812
Everybody at school thinks
I'm a freakin' idiot 'cause of you.

635
01:06:22,844 --> 01:06:25,184
You're gonna clean my van... right now.

636
01:06:25,203 --> 01:06:27,603
Get off of me, you bodaggit.

637
01:06:45,072 --> 01:06:48,057
Higher. No, no, higher.

638
01:06:48,603 --> 01:06:51,094
Yeah!

639
01:06:52,594 --> 01:06:53,852
Yeah!

640
01:06:54,313 --> 01:06:56,080
Yeah. Hit it!

641
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:01,883
Dang.

642
01:07:32,755 --> 01:07:36,986
Look, Pedro. I don't know
how they do things down in Juarez...

643
01:07:37,022 --> 01:07:40,608
but here in Idaho we have a
little something called pride.

644
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:43,072
Understand?

645
01:07:43,471 --> 01:07:47,815
Smashing in the face of a piñata
that resembles Summer Wheatly...

646
01:07:47,853 --> 01:07:52,245
is a disgrace to you, me
and the entire Gem State.

647
01:08:06,352 --> 01:08:09,938
<i>Welcome to D-Qwon's Dance Grooves.
Are you ready to get your groove on?</i>

648
01:08:09,966 --> 01:08:13,662
- Yes.
<i>- All right, then. Let's get started.</i>

649
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:27,230
Are you disqualified?

650
01:08:28,126 --> 01:08:33,324
No. They just made me take down
the flyers as a penalty for the piñatas.

651
01:08:34,469 --> 01:08:37,028
Can you still run for president?

652
01:08:37,063 --> 01:08:38,963
Yes.

653
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,321
I don't understand.

654
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:48,755
He say... you're not allowed to smash
piñatas that look like real people.

655
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:52,786
But we do it in Mexico all the time.

656
01:08:55,235 --> 01:08:57,135
Your hair looked great today.

657
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,250
Thank you.

658
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:06,574
All right. See you tomorrow, Pedro.

659
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,109
Who are you?

660
01:09:23,147 --> 01:09:26,548
- I'm Lafawnduh.
- What are you doing here?

661
01:09:27,609 --> 01:09:29,367
I'm waiting for Kip.

662
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:34,332
- Kip?
- Why are you so sweaty?

663
01:09:36,544 --> 01:09:38,701
- I been practising.
- Mmm.

664
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:42,622
- Practising what?
- Some dance moves.

665
01:09:44,885 --> 01:09:47,478
You like dancing?

666
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:51,259
My chores are done.

667
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:53,829
- So, you ready, Lafawnduh?
- I am, honey.

668
01:09:53,866 --> 01:09:56,858
Sorry, Napoleon. We're just runnin'
a little bit late for some prime rib.

669
01:09:56,914 --> 01:09:59,992
- Tell Uncle Rico not to wait up for me.
- Here.

670
01:10:00,035 --> 01:10:03,004
You might like that. My cousin made it.

671
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:05,819
I'll be waitin' outside for you, baby.

672
01:10:07,572 --> 01:10:09,472
Bye, Napoleon.

673
01:10:09,536 --> 01:10:11,041
See ya.

674
01:10:13,658 --> 01:10:17,690
Lafawnduh is the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

675
01:10:17,741 --> 01:10:20,437
I'm a hundred percent positive
that she's my soul mate.

676
01:10:20,559 --> 01:10:24,289
Napoleon, I'm sure there's a
babe out there for you too.

677
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,487
Peace out.

678
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:33,101
See ya.

679
01:10:52,546 --> 01:10:54,775
Is this what you were looking for?

680
01:10:54,864 --> 01:10:59,391
Nah, I was thinkin' of somethin'
a little more... soft around the edges.

681
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:01,814
Hmm. Well...

682
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:05,456
I have a nice, soft pink
sheet I could hang...

683
01:11:05,491 --> 01:11:10,518
and I could wrap you in some foam or...
something billowy?

684
01:11:12,703 --> 01:11:14,728
Yeah, billowy's good.

685
01:11:18,434 --> 01:11:21,645
It'd be really nice
if I could get the fan going.

686
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,234
I could hang some tinsel from the top.

687
01:11:27,396 --> 01:11:32,608
You know, Deborah, you have...
striking features.

688
01:11:32,683 --> 01:11:36,014
Such a soft face should
be complimented with a...

689
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:38,066
soft body.

690
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,217
Mr. Rico?

691
01:11:41,636 --> 01:11:45,231
My friends and clients,
they call me Uncle Rico.

692
01:11:49,082 --> 01:11:50,667
What are you doing?

693
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,688
Shh. Don't say another word.

694
01:11:55,025 --> 01:11:57,960
Napoleon told me you'd be interested.

695
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:06,379
Napoleon?

696
01:12:06,768 --> 01:12:09,937
You stop wishin', and call
me when you're ready.

697
01:12:42,425 --> 01:12:44,066
- Hello?
<i>- Napoleon?</i>

698
01:12:44,107 --> 01:12:46,905
- Yeah. Who's this?
- It's Deb...

699
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,510
and I'm calling to let you know
I think you're a shallow friend.

700
01:12:49,535 --> 01:12:52,846
- What the heck are you even talkin' about?
- Don't lie, Napoleon.

701
01:12:52,883 --> 01:12:55,330
Your Uncle Rico made it very
clear how you feel about me.

702
01:12:55,367 --> 01:12:56,561
What?

703
01:12:56,582 --> 01:12:59,243
I don't need herbal enhancers
to feel good about myself.

704
01:12:59,272 --> 01:13:03,402
And if you're so concerned about that,
why don't you try eating some yourself?

705
01:13:14,559 --> 01:13:15,425
Right on.

706
01:13:16,286 --> 01:13:19,051
Grandma just called and said
you're supposed to go home.

707
01:13:19,096 --> 01:13:22,604
- She didn't tell me anything.
- Too bad. She says she doesn't want you here...

708
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:26,180
when she gets back because you've been ruining
everybody's lives and eatin' all our steak.

709
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:29,574
- I'm not goin' anywhere, Napoleon.
- Get off my property!

710
01:13:30,062 --> 01:13:32,440
It's a free country.
I can do whatever I want.

711
01:13:32,565 --> 01:13:35,692
Get off my property, or
I'll call the cops on you.

712
01:13:36,106 --> 01:13:38,076
Well, then do it. Go on.

713
01:13:38,094 --> 01:13:40,062
Maybe I will. Gosh!

714
01:13:57,181 --> 01:13:59,066
- Hello?
- Pedro?

715
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,737
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

716
01:14:01,772 --> 01:14:05,003
Deb just called me.
She pretty much hates me by now.

717
01:14:05,038 --> 01:14:08,209
- Why?
- 'Cause my Uncle Rico's an idiot!

718
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,587
Do you have anything to give to her?

719
01:14:10,628 --> 01:14:14,119
No, not unless she likes fish.

720
01:14:15,548 --> 01:14:18,914
- Are you still gonna give your speech tomorrow?
- Yes.

721
01:14:19,626 --> 01:14:23,118
- Do you already know what you're gonna say?
<i>- Yes...</i>

722
01:14:23,595 --> 01:14:25,097
but not all of it.

723
01:14:25,121 --> 01:14:27,089
Just tell 'em that...

724
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:32,215
their wildest dreams will come
true if they vote for you.

725
01:14:34,068 --> 01:14:36,165
I'll see you tomorrow, Pedro.

726
01:14:53,534 --> 01:14:55,557
Dang it!

727
01:14:55,655 --> 01:14:57,885
What do you think you're doing?

728
01:15:40,644 --> 01:15:46,013
Now, if you look right here, we have
Sally Johnson from Manitou, Colorado.

729
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:49,754
Would you like to read her
testimonial right there?

730
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:51,771
Sure. Um...

731
01:15:51,806 --> 01:15:56,646
"After using Bust Must Plus,
I have such big bosoms..."

732
01:15:58,513 --> 01:16:00,829
I don't feel comfortable reading this.

733
01:16:00,872 --> 01:16:03,614
Oh, that's fine. That's fine.

734
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:06,063
But do you feel comfortable with me?

735
01:16:12,505 --> 01:16:14,769
You could be...

736
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:18,652
somewhere around, uh...

737
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:20,872
here.

738
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:27,179
Come here, boy!

739
01:16:40,782 --> 01:16:43,978
Well, I never thought I
would make it here today.

740
01:16:44,043 --> 01:16:46,136
I would be a great class
president because...

741
01:16:46,245 --> 01:16:49,736
I promise to put two new pop machines
in the cafeteria, and...

742
01:16:49,769 --> 01:16:53,582
I'm also gonna get a glitter Bonnebell
dispenser for all the girls' bathrooms.

743
01:16:53,629 --> 01:16:55,811
Oh, we're gonna get new
cheerleading uniforms.

744
01:16:55,919 --> 01:16:59,187
Anyway, I think I'd be a great
class president, so, uh...

745
01:16:59,218 --> 01:17:01,412
who wants to eat
chimini-changas next year?

746
01:17:02,129 --> 01:17:07,063
Not me. See, with me, it will
be summer all year long.

747
01:17:07,134 --> 01:17:08,616
Vote for Summer.

748
01:17:19,572 --> 01:17:24,201
And now Summer will perform her skit with
members of our very own Happy Hands Club.

749
01:17:26,923 --> 01:17:30,619
Your speech is up next.
Your skit had better be pretty good.

750
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,872
- A skit?
- You perform a skit after your speech, Pedro.

751
01:17:34,895 --> 01:17:37,624
What? A flippin' skit?

752
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:39,915
Why didn't anybody tell us about this?

753
01:18:40,871 --> 01:18:44,175
I don't want to be president anyway.

754
01:18:44,276 --> 01:18:46,801
Pedro, just listen to your heart.

755
01:18:46,912 --> 01:18:49,436
That's what I do.

756
01:18:50,682 --> 01:18:54,276
I'll just tell them that
I have nothing to say.

757
01:19:11,232 --> 01:19:13,199
Hello.

758
01:19:15,035 --> 01:19:16,935
I don't have much to say.

759
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:21,598
But I think it would be good to have some
holy Santos brought to the high school...

760
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:25,302
to guard the hallway and
to bring us good luck.

761
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:30,176
El Santo Niño de Atocha is a good one.
My Aunt Concha has seen him.

762
01:19:31,315 --> 01:19:33,215
And...

763
01:19:33,317 --> 01:19:36,843
we have a great F.F.A. Schedule lined up...

764
01:19:37,867 --> 01:19:40,148
And I'd like to see more of that.

765
01:19:43,792 --> 01:19:48,319
If you vote for me,
all of your wildest dreams will come true.

766
01:19:49,964 --> 01:19:51,487
Thank you.

767
01:20:11,016 --> 01:20:15,042
Up next, I hope you'll enjoy
a skit by Pedro Sanchez.

768
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:43,860
I caught you a delicious bass.

769
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:51,399
You wanna play me?

770
01:29:45,454 --> 01:29:49,931
I, uh, would like to give you this advice.

771
01:29:49,963 --> 01:29:53,091
And a fella give me some years ago.

772
01:29:53,197 --> 01:29:56,556
He said, "When an argument arises...

773
01:29:56,579 --> 01:30:01,497
"if you go outside and
take, uh, a nice walk...

774
01:30:01,778 --> 01:30:06,544
"you'll calm down and then you can
come back and it won't be an argument.

775
01:30:06,688 --> 01:30:08,528
"And you'll find that helps your health.

776
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:12,170
"All that fresh air and exercise
will do you a lot of good."

777
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:18,065
Is there anything else
you'd like to ask about?

778
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:25,885
Pedro.

779
01:30:26,894 --> 01:30:29,558
- Where the heck's Napoleon?
- I don't know.

780
01:30:29,613 --> 01:30:35,839
Lafawnduh Lucas, do you take
Kipland Ronald Dynamite...

781
01:30:35,876 --> 01:30:38,884
to be your lawful wedded husband...

782
01:30:38,969 --> 01:30:44,908
to honour in sickness and
health till death do you part?

783
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,369
I do.

784
01:30:48,884 --> 01:30:51,744
Kipland Ronald Dynamite...

785
01:30:51,767 --> 01:30:57,179
do you take Lafawnduh Lucas
to be your lawful wedded wife...

786
01:30:57,249 --> 01:31:00,601
in sickness and health
till death do you part?

787
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:03,016
You know I do.

788
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:08,756
By the authority vested in me,
I pronounce you man and wife.

789
01:31:09,732 --> 01:31:12,461

I just got done taming a wild
honeymoon stallion for you guys.

811
01:33:42,357 --> 01:33:45,690
Hey, Deb, can you take a photo of me
on the horse real quick?

812
01:33:46,036 --> 01:33:47,411
Sure.

813
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,164
Thanks.

Lookee, lookee.
A little keepsake for you guys.

816
01:34:35,483 --> 01:34:37,021
Lucky.
